# digiliblt
sample DigilibLT minicorpus for Cylleneus

This pre-indexed DigilibLT mini-corpus is provided for convenience and testing of Cylleneus. To use, clone this repository into 
the appropriate language folder hierarchy ``Cylleneus/corpus/lat`` within your user data directory.

On MacOS, this should be ``~/Library/Application Support/Cylleneus/corpus/lat``

Windows: ``C:\Documents and Settings\<User>\Application Data\Local Settings\Cylleneus\corpus\lat`` or ``C:\Documents and Settings\<User>\AppData\Local\Cylleneus\corpus\lat``

Linux: ``~/.local/share/Cylleneus/corpus/lat``

To check the exact location where corpora should be stored, once Cylleneus is installed you can run ``$ cylleneus where``.
